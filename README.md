Relational Database Design Process	
Identify at least 5 entity sets and their attributes (at least 3 attributes per entity), and describe these entities in your report along with their data types using a table like the one below.
As an example, one of my entity sets is Product Info.  It will have a part number, quantity, and cost.  My report might look like:
For my business, I will have the following entities:
	1. Product Info – describes the product, cost, and number in inventory
	2. Customer Info – describes names, ID#, date of first sale, and number of total sales
	3. Supplier Info – Name, Time to Deliver, Next delivery date, Qty expected
	4. Sales Info – Item sold, date, price, profit
	5. Store Info – Employee names, Employee Roles, ID#

Then I would show 5 charts that look like this:
Product Info	
Part Number	varChar[20]
Quantity	Integer
Cost	Float

Rubric: Your work will be graded as follows:
4 points for describing each of 5 entities and their attributes in your report (20 pts total)
